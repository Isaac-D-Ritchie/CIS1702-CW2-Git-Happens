These are the notes from Caileb Cook

Meeting at Catalyst on 11th November to discuss which API to work with and discuss operations found in Proposed_Plan_CW2
Myself, Corey and Isaac were present. I handed out physical copies of this document both there and later in our
labs session with other members who was not able to attend earlier in the day.

We drew by random our sub-teams that is
Red:    Blue:
Ben     Caileb
Corey   Isaac
Daniel  William

Red will start with the API section
Blue will start with the UI section

I also created a trello board to help us communicate our plans a little more effectively which was pinned in our whatsapp groupchat
https://trello.com/b/upcpg0h4/planning

1st week we advised one another to create pseudocode for core functions for our areas to be reviewed by the end of the week.


Plenty more to fill!
