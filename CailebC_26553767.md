These are the notes from Caileb Cook

Meeting at Catalyst on 11th November to discuss which API to work with and discuss operations found in Proposed_Plan_CW2
Myself, Corey and Isaac were present. I handed out physical copies of this document both there and later in our
labs session with other members who was not able to attend earlier in the day.

We drew by random our sub-teams that is
Red:    Blue:
Ben     Caileb
Corey   Isaac
Daniel  William

Red will start with the API section
Blue will start with the UI section

I also created a trello board to help us communicate our plans a little more effectively which was pinned in our whatsapp groupchat
https://trello.com/b/upcpg0h4/planning

1st week we advised one another to create pseudocode for core functions for our areas to be reviewed by the end of the week.


Edit 03/12/25:
After collectively spending more time on other work we have strategized this week on building flow charts for the project and will discuss over Discord
later in the week to see if a collective approach can be decided from and have a team Flow, along with this we'll discuss what data points we are interested in gathering.
Furthermore, How we all wish to represent our data. I think we've decided to not use the trello link as for a larger project it may have been useful but for this it seems like it
may hinder our work when we're having to update the trello on what we want to work on.

Below are my proposals for the Flowcharts and cover most of the main functionality of the program. I may not be free for the meeting on friday due to other commitments however will
seek to speak with group members on outcomes agreed upon for moving forward.

Big reflection on Lambdas and how that changed my outlook on how the data can be structured.
Plenty more to fill!
