These are the notes from Caileb Cook

Meeting at Catalyst on 11th November to discuss which API to work with and discuss operations found in Proposed_Plan_CW2
Myself, Corey and Isaac were present. I handed out physical copies of this document both there and later in our
labs session with other members who was not able to attend earlier in the day.

We drew by random our sub-teams that is
Red:    Blue:
Ben     Caileb
Corey   Isaac
Daniel  William

Red will start with the API section
Blue will start with the UI section

I also created a trello board to help us communicate our plans a little more effectively which was pinned in our whatsapp groupchat
https://trello.com/b/upcpg0h4/planning

1st week we advised one another to create pseudocode for core functions for our areas to be reviewed by the end of the week.


Edit 03/12/25:
After collectively spending more time on other work we have strategized this week on building flow charts for the project and will discuss over Discord
later in the week to see if a collective approach can be decided from and have a team Flow, along with this we'll discuss what data points we are interested in gathering.
Furthermore, How we all wish to represent our data. I think we've decided to not use the trello link as for a larger project it may have been useful but for this it seems like it
may hinder our work when we're having to update the trello on what we want to work on.

Below are my proposals for the Flowcharts and cover most of the main functionality of the program. I may not be free for the meeting on friday due to other commitments however will
seek to speak with group members on outcomes agreed upon for moving forward.

Big reflection on Lambdas and how that changed my outlook on how the data can be structured.
Edit 22/12/25:
Have built a working prototype of the program which includes: 
API, Backup Key and option for Backup API if Open Weather Map has downtime, All in a Class.
A Class for Datetime formatting which may or may not be implemented at some point soon.
Basic Menu which allows to Quit or Get 1 day reporting in one location.
1 Day report returns two types of report, a compact simple version or a more detailed and indepth version.
Comments have been made for where I'd like to log in operation of the program.
Have a to do list in the program to help keep me scheduled.

I plan to review other people's modules, programs and code over the next few days and give feedback and hope for the same in return.
One of the members of the group suggested creating a ui in an external library called pyqt6. I suggested to him that It would be better to try and implement Tkinter as I believe it's a part of the core python stack. Unfortunately I haven't heard back from him yet on that but hope the message was recieved well.

I plan for a meet up in discord after code reviewing has taken place so we can discuss what modules we would like to implement into the core program and what is remaining to be completed in the project (File Handling, Additional features, etc.)

Finally,
The lecture we had the week we broke up for christmas gave me amazing insight into understanding the use cases of classes and took great advantage to re-apply how I initially wanted to store the API information and functions, It allowed me to throw it all under one hood modularly. Logging also was great to know about and I plan to integrate that soon into the program so the log file can paint an adequate portrait of how well the program is running.

Plenty more to fill!
