# We have chosen to develop Project Brief 2 (API Data Analyser & Reporter)
# Project Brief:

● Project Goal: Develop a command-line tool that fetches data from a public API, performs a simple analysis, and generates a report file.

● Key Functional Requirements: CIS1702 – Programming 1 (25/26) 4

● The application must interact with a free, public JSON API (e.g., a weather API, a public data API like REST Countries, or a fun API like the Pokémon API).

● The user should be able to input a query (e.g., a city name, a country, a Pokémon name).

● The program must make a request to the API and parse the returned JSON data.

● Data Extraction: Extract at least four key pieces of information from the JSON response.

● Simple Analysis: Perform a simple calculation or data transformation (e.g. convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, calculate population density, list a Pokémon's abilities).

● Display Output: Print a clean, formatted summary of the extracted and analysed data to the console.

● Generate Report: Save the formatted summary to a text file (e.g., report.txt). Each new report should be appended to the file.

● The program must include robust error handling for network issues, invalid user input, or missing data in the API response (using try-except blocks).

● Possible Extensions:
- Allow the user to make multiple requests in a loop until they choose to exit.
- Compare data from two different API calls (e.g., compare the populations of two countries).
- Save report data in a structured format like CSV.
  
● Marking Focus Areas: Correct use of libraries to fetch web data, robust JSON parsing, comprehensive error handling (especially for external services), modular code (functions for fetching, parsing, and reporting), and clear output formatting.
